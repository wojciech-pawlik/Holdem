Project includes classes neccessary to write poker (Texas Holdâ€™em) algorithms:
- comparing hands (class 'Uklad')
- run of the game (class 'Rozdanie')
- calculating chances

Things to do:
- fix the class 'Rozdanie'
- rename everything into English (when I started this project, I didn't care about it)
